## Executive Summary
I am a technology executive who combines solid business acumen, technical experience, coaching and leadership skills to build global organizations, teams, solutions and businesses in the fields of Information Technology, Engineering and R&D Services.

With deep knowledge and experience across many industries, domains, and delivery models, I connect customers, business solutions and engineering to translate strategies into execution and transform needs into consistent architectures and profitable technical solutions.

I'm pragmatic in the short-term and visionary in the long-term. I'm a technology-agnostic who believes technology is an enabler you can use to achieve our goals and improve people's lives.

I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional network. Feel free to connect via LinkedIn.
