I am a technology executive passionate about building successful organizations and helping teams and people achieve their goals, leveraging my solid business acumen, technical expertise, and leadership skills to create global organizations, teams, solutions, and businesses in the fields of Information Technology, Engineering, and R&D Services.

With extensive knowledge and experience across various domains, industries, and delivery models, I connect customers, business solutions, and engineering to translate strategies into execution and transform needs into consistent architectures and profitable technical solutions.

Through my expertise in leadership coaching, business, and technology, I bring a powerful tool to individuals and teams to unlock their potential, fostering confidence and empowering them to discover new possibilities for success, approach challenges with confidence and resilience, and uncover their unique talents and abilities.

As a technology-agnostic leader, I believe that technology is an enabler that can improve people’s lives, and I am committed to using my coaching and leadership skills to help organizations achieve their goals while positively impacting the world around us.
