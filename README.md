# Made in Pontedera, living in Berlin

I’m a technology executive with two decades of experience leading global teams and delivering transformational results across Information Technology, Engineering, and R&D Services. I'm passionate about building successful organizations and helping teams and individuals achieve their goals—both through the power of technology and the potential of people.

With deep cross-industry expertise and a strong foundation in business, technology, and leadership, I’ve built and scaled global organizations, connected strategy to execution, and translated complex needs into consistent architectures and profitable solutions. I thrive at the intersection of customers, business, and engineering—ensuring that solutions not only work, but work for people.

I’m also a certified executive coach, and I bring that mindset into everything I do. I help teams unlock confidence, resilience, and creativity—fostering cultures where people can grow, contribute, and lead with purpose.

Technology is not the goal—it’s the enabler. As a technology-agnostic leader, I believe in using the right tools to make a real difference. Whether guiding organizations through change, architecting impactful solutions, or coaching leaders to new heights, I’m driven by a simple mission: empower people, create value, and make a positive impact on the world.
